// Some basic stuff about cpp

// Skeleton of cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main(){
    cout << "hello rishabh, keep moving forward" << endl;
    return 0;
}


// #include <iostream> ... in order to take an input or output we use <iostream> and
// in order to use this library we use #include.

// using namespace std; ... by using this we do not need to write
// std in each line. like std::cout << "hello rishabh, keep moving forward" << endl;

// cout << .. it is used for printing output.

// cin >> .. it is used for taking input from user.

// endl; or "\n" .. takes you to the next line but \n is faster.


// use #include<bits/stdc++.h> ... it includes all the library available in cpp.


/* 
Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). 
This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
